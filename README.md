## Bron Cena

When a wild Bron appears, the John Cena theme tune will play.

You don't have to be Kyrian to enjoy this add-on ! When someone near you summons Bron, the theme will play.

### Commands & Configuration

`/bron` to open up the options.

## Installation & Setup

### Add on

You should be able to search for `Bron Cena` in your favourite WoW add-on manager.

Otherwise, the add-on is available directly from any of the following:

* [Curse Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bron-cena)
* [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26129-BronCena.html)
* [Wago AddOns](https://addons.wago.io/addons/broncena)

### Weak Aura

If you prefer the original Weak Aura, it's [here @ wago.io](https://wago.io/DEK3sUJrH), though you'll need to manually download and install the audio.

### FAQ

#### How can I make the sounds lounder?

Open up the `Game Menu` and go to `System` > `Sound` . In the `Volume` panel, you can adjust the `Master Volume` or each individual channel.

Bron Cena uses the `Dialog` channel by default.

If you wish to change the sound channel Bron Cena uses, you can open the options and even set the sound channel individually for each companion.

### How can I change which sounds I want for Bron or the other companions?

Open up the options and in the Companions tab, select your companion and then choose from the drop-down list of sounds, including those from other mods like BigWigs or DBM.

### How do I add my own sounds?

Your sound should by in the `.ogg` format. You can put it somewhere under your WoW folder, but ideally place it under `Interface\Addons\BronCena\Media\Sounds` with the rest of the Bron Cena sounds.

Now, when you edit an existing companion or create a new one, you must choose <Custom> from the Sound drop-down, and enter your path e.g. `Interface\Addons\BronCena\Media\Sounds\MyCustomSound.ogg`
