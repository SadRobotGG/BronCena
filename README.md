## Bron Cena

With the launch of Dragonflight, Bron is taking a break.

However, I'll be updating this mod to make it an easy way to add fun sound cues and sound packs to the game.

### Commands & Configuration

`/bron` to open up the options.

## Installation & Setup

### Add on

You should be able to search for `Bron Cena` in your favourite WoW add-on manager.

Otherwise, the add-on is available directly from any of the following:

* [Curse Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bron-cena)
* [WoW Interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26129-BronCena.html)
* [Wago AddOns](https://addons.wago.io/addons/broncena)

### Weak Aura

If you prefer the original Weak Aura, it's [here @ wago.io](https://wago.io/DEK3sUJrH), though you'll need to manually download and install the audio.

### FAQ

#### How can I make the sounds lounder?

Open up the `Game Menu` and go to `System` > `Sound` . In the `Volume` panel, you can adjust the `Master Volume` or each individual channel.

Bron uses the `Dialog` channel by default.

If you wish to change the sound channel Bron Cena uses, you can open the options and even set the sound channel individually for each companion.

### I don't like the John Cena theme! How can I change which sounds I want for Bron or the other companions?

Open up the options and in the Companions tab, select your companion and then choose from the drop-down list of sounds, including those from other mods like BigWigs or DBM.

### How do I add my own sounds?

Your sound should by in the `.ogg` format. You can put it somewhere under your WoW folder, but ideally place it under `Interface/Addons/BronCena/Media/Sounds` with the rest of the Bron Cena sounds.

Now, when you edit an existing companion or create a new one, you must choose <Custom> from the Sound drop-down, and enter the path to your sound file e.g. `Interface/Addons/BronCena/Media/Sounds/MyCustomSound.ogg`

### Can you I suggest a sound or companion to support?

Sure, just log an issue and we'll look into it!

### Can I use Bron Cena's sounds in my own weak auras or addons?

Sure. Bron Cena's sounds get registered in the shared media library, so will show up in the sounds drop-downs in Weak Auras, Big Wigs, DBM and other add-ons.
