# Changelog

## 1.6.2

* FIXED #10: Oops, Wo buff Benny Hill was bugged! Thanks @tryallthethings

## 1.6.1

* Booping version to support 9.2.5

## 1.6.0

Let's Get David Sued by Music Publishers Edition (tm)

These new "companions" are disabled by default so be sure to type in `/bron` to enable them

* ADDED #7: Play Benny Hill Theme (Yakety Sax) when you get Wo buff. This way when you really wanted Urh buff, you can't stay mad. Requested by @Totahat
* ADDED #9: "Hello Darkness, my old friend" from Sound of Silence when Havoc Demon Hunter plants Darkness. Requested by Craiguz
* Some initial support for hunter pets

## 1.5.1

* ADDED #6: When a "bug" returns as a feature: You can now choose "Allow overlapping sounds" in the `/bron` options, so you can hear the ~~cacophany~~ sweet symphony of many Bron Cena themes playing out of sync together from the many Kyrian kings & queens in your 40-man raid. You asked for it, @tryallthethings.
* CHANGED: Kyrian Steward is disabled by default. I think it low key might be giving people heart attacks who are only expecting Bron Cena sounds.

## 1.5.0

* Updated to patch 9.2.0

## 1.4.5

* Update to patch 9.1.5
* FIXED: Sounds shouldn't overlap, so if a bunch of Brons appear rapidly, it will just restart the theme and not play a bunch all out of sync

## 1.4.4

* FIXED: Kyrian Steward refused to be silenced by your puny "Disabled" option! Now you should be able to stop them playing the song of their people. Thanks @junghee

## 1.4.3

* FIXED: Missing library

Thanks: @DoyleD

## 1.4.2

* PERF: Performance improvements.

## v1.3

* FIXED: Some issues with the packaging of the addon. With the 3rd party libraries and audio files, this addon is now as swole as Bron himself.

Thanks: Kirasta
